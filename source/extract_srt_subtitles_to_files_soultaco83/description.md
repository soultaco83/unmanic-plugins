Any SRT subtitle streams found in the file will be exported as *.srt files in the same directory as the original file.

:::warning
This plugin is not compatible with linking as the remote link will not have access to the original source file's directory.
I offer no guarantee for this plugin. This works for my use case. Please do tests first.
